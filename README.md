**IAGO** </br>
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe ’t. </br>
That she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit. </br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, </br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, </br>
And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona </br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too, </br>

** <p style="color:#de7caa;"> Iago establishes that he knows that Othello is loyal to Desdemona, which is proved throughout the story. For example, earlier in the scene, Othello says "My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, / My Desdemona must I leave to thee" (Act 1.3.335-337). </p>**

Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure </br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin) </br>
But partly led to diet my revenge </br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor </br>

** <p style="color:#de7caa;"> The line about his suspicion of Othello directly contradicts his previous statement about Othello's faithfulness. This proves that he has no evidence to back up his suspicions, and even he knows that they are probably baseless and untrue. </p>**

Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof </br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, </br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul </br>
Till I am evened with him, wife for wife, </br>
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor </br>
At least into a jealousy so strong </br>

** <p style="color:#de7caa;"> Wants to send Othello into a "jealousy so strong", but the whole speech shows that Iago is already experiencing such strong jealousy. </p>**

That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, </br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace </br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, </br>
I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, </br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb </br>
(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too), </br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me </br>
For making him egregiously an ass </br>
And practicing upon his peace and quiet </br>
Even to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confused. </br>
Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used. </br>

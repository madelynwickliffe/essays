**IAGO** </br>
That ==Cassio=={Q6829164} loves her, I do well believe ’t. </br>
That she loves him, ’tis [apt](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/apt) and of great credit. </br>
The Moor, [howbeit](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/howbeit) that I endure him not, </br>
<span style="color:#c9b36d; background-color:#f5ecd0";>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</span> </br>
<span style="color:#c9b36d; background-color:#f5ecd0";>And I dare think he’ll prove to ==Desdemona=={Q3272719}</span></br>
<span style="color:#c9b36d; background-color:#f5ecd0";>A most dear husband.</span> Now, I do love her too, </br>

** <p style="color:#c9b36d;"> Iago establishes that he knows that Othello is loyal to Desdemona, which is proved throughout the story. For example, earlier in the scene, Othello says "My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, / My Desdemona must I leave to thee" (Act 1.3.335-337). </p>**

Not out of absolute lust (though [peradventure](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/peradventure) </br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin) </br>
But partly led to diet my revenge </br>
For that I do <span style="color:#de7caa; background-color:#f5d5e4";>suspect the lusty Moor</span> </br>

** <p style="color:#de7caa;"> The line about his suspicion of Othello directly contradicts his previous statement about Othello's faithfulness. This proves that he has no evidence to back up his suspicions, and even he knows that they are probably baseless and untrue. </p>**

<p>Hath leaped into my seat—the thought whereof </br>
Doth, like a <span style="color:#7d68ad";>poisonous mineral</span>, gnaw my inwards, </p>

And nothing can or shall content my soul </br>
Till I am <span style="color:#7794b5; background-color:#c1d9f5";>evened with him, wife for wife</span>, </br>
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor </br>
At least into <span style="color:#7794b5; background-color:#c1d9f5";>a jealousy so strong</span> </p>

** <p style="color:#7794b5;"> Wants to send Othello into a "jealousy so strong", but the whole speech shows that Iago is already experiencing such strong jealousy. Shows that part of Iago's motivation might be to cause Othello to experience the same internal struggles as himself, which adds on to the idea of being "evened" with him.  </p>**

That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, </br>
If this poor trash of <span style="color:#7d68ad";>**Venice**</span>, whom I trace </br>

For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, </br>
I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, </br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb </br>
<span style="color:#de7caa; background-color:#f5d5e4";>(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too)</span> </br>

** <p style="color:#de7caa;"> Shows how paranoia and jealousy lead Iago into a spiral, similar to the one we will later see Othello experience. Iago goes from being paranoid about Othello, to now also being parnoid about Cassio. </p>**

Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me </br>
For making him [egregious](https://)ly an ass </br>

Even to color <span style="color:#7794b5; background-color:#c1d9f5";>madness</span>. ’Tis here, but yet confused. </br>
